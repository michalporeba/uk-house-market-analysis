# UK House Price Analysis Notebooks

The repository contains a collection of [Marimo](https://docs.marimo.io/index.html) notebooks
created to assist with UK house price analysis using publically available data.

## How to start?

1. Get a copy of this repository - it does contain the code and the notebooks, but not the data.</br>

git clone git@github.com:michalporeba/uk-house-market-analysis.git
```
2. Install Marimo, for example with</br>
```bash
pip install marimo
```
3. Open and execute the get_data.py notebook.</br>

marimo edit get_data.py
```
4. Execute the notebook. This will take considerable amount of time as it will download over 5GB of data.
